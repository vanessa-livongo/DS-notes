# The Visualization Dashboard
## Visualization Systems
- Information Visualization - plotting data often using different coordinates than what is provided
- Large Data Visualization - interactively manage visually overwhemling amounts of data
- Visual Analytics - connecting data visualization and decision making
- Dashboard - Organize the visual display of information to provide necessary details

- Zoom: _Removing extraneous data_
- Focus: _Retains context without cropping away data outside of zoomed portion_
  - Interative lens
- Filter
- Details on Demand
  - Tooltip
  - Field Selection

## Database Visualization
- OLAP: Online Analytical  Processing
- Data Cube: multidimensional spreadsheet (hypercube if > 3 dimensions)
- Dimension: database key
- Measure: database values
- Cell: element of the data cube holding specific values for each of the dimensions

### Data Aggregation
- Quantitative
- Count
- Binning

## Visualization System Design
- Requirements Specification
  - what specific problems will the system solve
  - who will the system serve
  - how will a user use the system to make a decision
- Architectural Design: decompose the problem into components (elements of a dashboard)
- Component Design:  Select the best tools, visualizations, interactions for each component
- Implementation: coding and setup
- Component Testing: debugging, test after each step
- User Evaluation
- Maintenance: documentation
