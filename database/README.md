**Relational**
- Stored in table
- Each table has a schema: columns & types
- No duplicate rows
- Foreign keys relate to other tables
- Change in a schema must be applied to all records

**Non-relational**
- schema-less
- Records can have different schemas
- Applicable to constantly changing schema
