### 1. Define
_Who this dashboard is for and what metrics matter to them_

#### Stakeholders
- The designer (you)
- The audience
- The point person (the member of audience who has the most experience)
- The Data Gatekeeper (the member of the data team who will help withh the database)

#### Define the Decisions
- Worst Case Scenario: how did this happen? What decisions led to this outcome? Waht decisions were made with a lack of data?
- Prioritize decisions

#### Define the Metrics
- What data would help inform that decision?
- What other data might be useful to add context?
- How else could we improve this decision’s quality?

### 2. Prototype
#### Selecting Visualizations

- Consider limiting the number of categories by using an “Other” bucket, color the Other column grey to deemphasize this category, since it is a grouping of multiple categories

#### Alignment & Grouping
- If a specific metric is displayed in two charts, they should be placed right next to each other
- Line charts with the same time frame should be stacked vertically to facilitate comparisons
- Put items next to each other with no separation to use the same title for both visualizations

#### Limited Variety
- The average viewership peaks when six different types of charts are used

### 3. Build
- Find the Data
  - Do we have the data available
  - Where is the data stored
  - Is the data messy

### 4. Deploy
- Sharing
  - Provide enough training to the audience
- Scaling
  - Adding links, interactivity, and documentation
  - Optimizing queries
- Maintenance
  - Setting up scheduled times to review
  - Providing a way for audience to provide feedback
