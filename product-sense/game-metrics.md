# Game Metrics
- User Acquisition Metrics
- User Retention Metrics

## User Acquisition Metrics
### New users
  - Number of daily, weekly, and monthly new user sign-ups
  - Metrics by user acquisition channel
### Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - Number of unique users that participate in at least one session of the game
### MAU
  - Pitfalls
    - Doesn't distinguish between different activity patterns
      - users register and active for one month only
      - 100 users register for the first month, only these users are active every month
  - Breakdown to new users, retained users (stay active), resurrected users (weren't active, return to active)
### K-factor
  - summarize the effectiveness of the referral growth strategy
  - (Amount of invites sent by each customer of the app) * (conversion of each invite)
### Number of invites sent / DAU
  - How well the referral program is retaining the users

### DAU/MAU
  - Measures how often users engage with an app on average - Stickiness
  - DAU/MAU = 0.3, users use the app for 0.3 * 30 days = 9 days each month on average

## User Retention Metrics
1. Retention
  - seperate users into cohorts based on the day of acquisition
  - monitor how they interact with the game on day 1, 3, 7, and 30
2. Engagement Score
  - Segmenting and identifying feature of each cohort
  - <img src="https://www.cooladata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Segmenting-Analyzing-User-Behavior.png">  
  - number of Friends Added
  - number of Games Played
  - number of Forum posts
3. Number of sessions per user
4. Drop-off rates
  - Ensure users get through all of the steps of the game
5. Session duration
  - Compare the behavior of users with high average session duartion with churned users
6. User walk
  - how many new installs
  - how many of installs are reactivated users
  - how many of installls are moving toward a churn
  - organized by user cohort
7. Daily active users / Monthly active users (DAU/MAU)
8. Source, sink, and flow metrics (for in-app currency ststem)
  - Source: amount of currency a user has earned as they progress through the game
  - Sink: the stages at which a user needs to spend the currency to move forward
  - Flow: total balance of currency a player has earned and spent
  - See how to nudge a player toward in-app purchases
9. Start, fail, and complete metrics
  - Start: Average number of times players has started a new level
  - Fail: number of times a user started a level but wasn't able to complete it
  - Complete: count of how many times the user has been completed a level
  - Analyze the learning curve of the game

## Monetization Metric
1. Customer lifetime value (LTV)
  - net profit generates from a user before they churn
2. User Acquisition Cost (UAC)
  - Make sure LTV is 3 times higher than UAC
  - Amount of marketing acquisition costs spent to acquire a user
  - Maximize ROIs on acquisition strategies
3. Average revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU)
  - Understand how the game is performing on a day-to-day basis
4. Average revenue per paying user (ARPPU)
  - Hardcore games tend to see higher ARPPU, appeal to a narrow audience
5. Average transaction value
  - Average amount a user is willing to pay for an in-game upgrade/currency
  - Measure on a weekly/biweekly basis

## Measuring Success
1. Combine acquisition and retention, to see which markets bring the most stable and satisfied customers
2. Combine retention and monetization, to see which kind of user behavior translates into most profitable users
