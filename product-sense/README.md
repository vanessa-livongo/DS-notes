2.  What channel is driving the most valuable traffic, in other words, performs best (%) in terms of customer conversion?
3. What channel has the lowest customer acquisition cost ($), i.e. cost per customer converted?

### Activation
- An activated customer is someone who keeps coming back to use your product
- Get users to the “Aha Moment” as quickly as possible

> Twitter realized that once you followed 30 people you were more likely to come back so they suggest popular accounts when you sign up. Dropbox saw that users who uploaded at least one file were much more likely to use Dropbox again and so, you guessed it, they encourage you to upload a file during signup.

### Retention
Users keep coming back and opening / using the app
