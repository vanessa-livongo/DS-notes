# Artificial Neural Networks
1. Forward propagation
2. Backpropagation
3. Activation Functions

## Activation function
_Decides whether a neuron should be activated or not -> whether the information the neurou receives is relevant or not_

- Enable non-linear transformation -> to perform more complex task
- A neural network without activation function is just a linear regression model

## Forward propagation

- The output of the first neuron will be passed as the input of the second neuron
