- Don't make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data
- With a large sample of 30+, the theorem will always ring true
- Usage: perform hypothesis test

## Law of large numbers
_As the size of a sample is increased, the estimate of the sample mean wil more accurately reflect the population mean_
